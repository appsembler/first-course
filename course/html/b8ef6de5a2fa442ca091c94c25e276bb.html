<p><span class="fa fa-flask" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</span><span class="sr">How it's made:</span> As we mentioned just now, that was an ORA - an Open Response Assessment.</p>
  <p>In this case, we set it up for Staff Grading with a few other options enabled, such as the ability to attach a file (so long as it's an image or a PDF), but there are a lot of other options available in this one XBlock, including Peer Assessment and Self-Reflection. For the guided submission of open assessments, the ORA XBlock is the way to go. Check out our article on <a href="https://help.appsembler.com/article/241-open-response-assessment-ora-basic-walkthrough" target="_blank">using Open Response Assessments</a> for full details on how to get this powerful XBlock up and running in your own courses!</p>
