<p>In a previous section, you learned&nbsp;that Open edX is the&nbsp;learner-centric and massively scalable learning platform that you're in right now. And while&nbsp;Open edX is&nbsp;many wonderful things, what <a href="https://www.appsembler.com/blog/want-host-open-edx-top-3-things-consider/" target="_blank">it's <strong>NOT</strong> is easy to set up</a>. Creating, theming&nbsp;and hosting your own Open edX site is&nbsp;expensive&nbsp;and time-intensive, and requires a skilled team and resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why we created Tahoe! Appsembler Tahoe enables you to&nbsp;quickly create your own Open edX site, via an easy-to-use management console. You can easily brand and style your&nbsp;learning&nbsp;site - no technical skills, resources, or third party dependencies required.&nbsp;</p>
