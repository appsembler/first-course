<p>Redis Labs, ranked as a leader in NoSQL, in-memory databases, operational databases, and database-as-a-service (DBaaS), is trusted by more than 7,400 enterprise customers. Their software training platform is hosted on Tahoe, as <a href="https://university.redislabs.com" target="_blank">Redis University</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Redis University makes use of the two main features of Virtual Labs. They offer asynchronous, self-paced training for new and advanced users of their software. And they use our Live Events tool to power learning at events like RedisConf.</p>
<p>In previous years, Redis tried to provide hand-on learning on attendee's machines. But the setup process for a large class of learners was a major logistical and technical challenge. They were experiencing times where they had to give up on the hands-on sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Labs solved this, providing a very different, seamless experience for learners.</strong> Users just launched a browser, logged into a virtual lab, and instantly were using Redis! Thanks to Virtual Labs, hundreds of conference attendees used were able to launch labs and take part in hands-on training exercises on the conference floor.</p>

<p>Their core Redis University offering, however, is where the magic happens. Check out their launch trailer below, because Alvin explains it better than we ever could.</p>
