<p>While creating your course in Studio, you have the option to add an <strong>Advanced</strong> component called an <strong>XBlock</strong>.</p>
<p style="border: 1px solid #ccc; display: block; margin: 20px 0; padding: 20px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;">The XBlock infrastructure is a component architecture designed to make it easier to create new online educational experiences. What this means in practice is we'll sometimes add native-level support for new tools and activities that are as easy to use as the existing features like videos and discussions.</p>
<p>The XBlocks we currently have installed and support (at the time of this course) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Polls</strong> - remember that poll from an earlier module? That's an XBlock!</li>
<li><strong>Surveys</strong> - Similar to a poll, but allows you to ask many questions with the same answer options, instead of just one</li>
<li><strong>Peer Instruction</strong> -&nbsp;Allows&nbsp;learners to answer a question, and see what everyone else thought and why</li>
<li><strong>Open Response Assessments</strong> - Lets&nbsp;learners grade each other, grade themselves, or wait for a staff to grade an essay or file submission</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Labs Container Launcher</strong> - Enables you to embed a software Virtual Lab into your course (you saw this one in an earlier module too!)</li>
<li><strong>LTI Consumer</strong> - LTI stands for Learning Tools Interoperability,&nbsp;which&nbsp;enables you to&nbsp;pull in&nbsp;learning content from 3rd party sources (like SCORM, or H5P).</li>
<li><strong>Peer Instruction</strong> - Allows learners to answer a question, and see what everyone else thought and why, to arrive at a deeper understanding of concepts</li>
<li><strong>Open Response Assessments</strong> - Lets learners grade each other, grade themselves, or wait for a staff to grade an essay or file submission</li>
<li><strong>Staff Graded Assignment</strong> - Allows learners to upload a file for manual staff grading</li>
<li><strong>Free-text Response</strong> - Allows instructors to create questions that expect a free-text response</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Labs Container Launcher</strong> - Enables you to embed a software Virtual Lab into your course (you saw this one in an earlier module too!)</li>
<li><strong>LTI Consumer</strong> - LTI stands for Learning Tools Interoperability, which enables you to pull in learning content from 3rd party sources (like SCORM, or H5P).</li>
<li><strong>Google Document</strong> - Enables embedding of Google Documents within a cours</li>
<li><strong>Google Calendar</strong> - Enables embedding of a Google Calendar within a course</li>
<li><strong>PDF</strong> - Simplifies embedding a PDF in a page.pdf</li>
<li><strong>Problem Builder</strong> - Provides an increased range of problem options for posing more varied questions problem-builder</li>
<li><strong>Step Builder</strong> - Enables you to ask questions in a sequence rather than listing them down a page.</li>
<li><strong>Completion</strong> - Allows a learner to mark an activity as complete and earn a mark for their progress chart</li>
<li><strong>Vector Drawing</strong> - create vector drawing exercises</li>
</ul>
