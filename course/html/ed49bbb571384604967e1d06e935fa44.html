<ul>
<li>The LMS: Where learners learn stuff and instructors handle learner management</li>
<li>Studio: Where courses are built and maintained</li>
<li>The Management Console: Where your define your site's look and feel and manage site-wide content</li>
<li>Figures: Where you get data about your learners and courses</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are currently a <strong>Trial user,</strong> you are on the <strong>Tahoe Starter plan</strong>. Which means&nbsp;you get every&nbsp;bit of this!&nbsp;Next up, we'll break down each section and tell you&nbsp;which&nbsp;things you can accomplish where.</p>
