<h3>Tasks for your Virtual Lab</h3>
<p>Open the index.html file:</p>
<h3>Step 1: Modify the HTML: Add some motivational content!</h3>
<p>Any good todo app needs motivational content! Paste the code below into the <code>index.html</code> file; place it below the <code>&lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> tag. That section of the file should then look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html" lang="html">...
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;blockquote id="motivation" class="motivation"&gt;
      Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.
      The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond
      of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with
      them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because
      they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the
      crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can
      change the world, are the ones who do.&rdquo; &ndash; Rob Siltanen
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;!-- CSS Styles are 100% optional. but they make it look *much* nicer --&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/todomvc-common-base.css"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/todomvc-app.css"&gt;
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>Then click "File" &gt; "Save All". If you've added motivational HTML snippet properly and saved properly, the page should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/static/avl_lab_1.png" alt="display motivational content" width="55%" /></p>
<h3>Step 2: Modify the CSS: Style the motivational quote</h3>
<p>We should change the style of that motivational quote, though. Open the <code>lib/todomvc-app.css</code> file and add the snippet below to the bottom of it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css" lang="css">blockquote.motivation {
  margin-top: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  margin-left: 50px;
  padding-left: 15px;
  border-left: 3px solid #ccc;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then click "File &gt; Save All". The app should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/static/avl_lab_2.png" alt="style blockquote" width="55%" /></p>
<p>You will have noticed that it's a bit cumbersome to navigate between the <code>.html</code> and the <code>.css</code> files. Grab the tab of the <code>.css</code> file and drag it to a better position, then click "View" &gt; "Collapse All Side Panels":</p>

<h3>Step 3: Modify the JavaScript: Disable the motivational quote</h3>
<p>It's good to have some motivation when starting a task list, but perhaps your user does not want that motivational quote hanging around. When the user clicks away, we should hide the motivational quote; do that by adding this snippet to your JavaScript file located at <code>lib/todo-app.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript" lang="javascript">/* hide the motivational quote when the user clicks away */
window.onload = function(){
  var divToHide = document.getElementById('motivation');
  document.onclick = function(e){
    if(e.target.id !== 'motivation'){
      //element clicked wasn't the div; hide the div
      divToHide.style.display = 'none';
    }
  };
};
</code></pre>
<p>Then click "Save All". If you added the JavaScript snippet in the right spot, the motivational quote should be disappear when the user clicks to add a todo item:</p>
<p><img src="/static/Screen_Recording_2020-11-25_at_14.52.54.gif" alt="disable motivational quote" width="55%" /></p>
