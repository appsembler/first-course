<p>As you've seen, the Tahoe Starter plan is powerful in its own right, and enables you to deliver scalable and engaging online learning. But some customers need more integration, customization, or control over their site. This is where a Tahoe Pro plan can help! Here's what you gain by turning Pro:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.appsembler.com/blog/feature-release-build-your-brand-with-custom-domains/" target="_blank">Custom Domains</a></strong><br />A Custom URL is one of the easiest ways to build your brand, engage learners, and develop a consistent user experience. Plus, a custom domain helps your organization get found on the internet, while providing a seamless way for learners to find, revisit, and share the courses on your site.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.appsembler.com/blog/announcing-course-access-groups/" target="_blank"><strong>Course Access Groups</strong><br /></a>Offer different sets of courses to learners, depending on their group membership. Train your customers, certify your partners, and skill up your employees on how to use your product. Leverage education as marketing to get prospective customers interacting with your software. Scale up quickly to train learners around the world. Meet each of these needs all within Tahoe, and offer different sets of classes to each group.<a href="https://www.appsembler.com/blog/announcing-course-access-groups/" target="_blank"><br /></a></p>
