<p>Chef Software created their&nbsp;own homegrown learning platform&nbsp;to help their users grow their&nbsp;skills and tackle DevOps and automation business problems. Over&nbsp;several years they learned&nbsp;what their community wanted in a learning platform. The most common requests from&nbsp;their users included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different formats of content</li>
<li>Improved hands-on experiences</li>
<li>The ability to share achievements publicly</li>
<li>More content, faster</li>
</ul>
<p>Chef realized they had outgrown their platform, and were looking for a solutions that would enable them to do all this, as well as provide hands-on labs. In their own words:</p>
<p>"Today at ChefConf Online we took the wraps off Learn Chef, our new online learning platform for the Chef community. As you navigate the courses, you&rsquo;ll find it easier to track progress through the courses and discover new training releases. In addition, our new courses will feature in-browser, hands-on labs. These guided experiences will let you start applying your knowledge in a real environment, without having to install a local version of Chef or deal with spinning up Docker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with new content and learning environments, we have made big improvements around tracking and sharing progress in an open and flexible way. Introducing a new badging system built on the Open Badges specification allows you to track your learning progress and easily share your accomplishments on professional networks, such as LinkedIn. The specification also features Badge Pathways building connections of awards into a journey of achievement.</p>
<p>As we continue to reimagine the next generation of Chef certifications, these improvements will allow our customers and partners to share validation of learning achievements in more meaningful ways."&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.chef.io/learn-chef-in-a-whole-new-way/" target="_blank">(You can read more about&nbsp;of their&nbsp;learning site launch here.)</a></p>
