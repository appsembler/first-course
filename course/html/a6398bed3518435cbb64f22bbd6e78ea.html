It's where the learning happens, and where you manage your learners. You can poke around this site to experience it for yourself as a learner!</p>
<p>There's an integrated discussion forum that&nbsp;can appear in the content (which you can see for yourself soon!), custom pages for things like author bios and syllabus, a news and updates area... basically <strong style="font-size: 1em;">everything you need to get learning</strong><span style="font-size: 1em;">.</span>.</p>
