<p><strong>Figures</strong> is the lightweight reporting app built by Appsembler and adopted into the open source community of Open edX. It can&nbsp;help you understand your return on learning, from the high level to the granular &ndash; overall trends to individual learner progress.</p>
<p>As we look to the future with Figures, in addition to continuing to develop it ourselves we hope to cultivate a sense of collaboration with the larger Open edX community to rapidly innovate and improve the efficacy of analytics. Together, we aim to build the best reporting tool that provides course authors, instructors, and training professionals with flexible and user-driven reporting that informs decisions, improves performance, and streamlines the entire process.</p>
