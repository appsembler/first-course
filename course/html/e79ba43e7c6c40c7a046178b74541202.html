<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Welcome to the Appsembler&nbsp;sample course!</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">This course serves&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">Share a bit about Appsembler</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">Demo a finished course built with Tahoe and hosted on Open edX</span></li>
<li><span>Give you something to get started with to avoid the dreaded 'blank page syndrome'</span></li>
<li>Provide tips and insights into how we built this course (#soMeta)</li>
<li>Showcase our hand-on Virtual Labs tool and our premium Tahoe features</li>
</ul>
<p>We suggest going through the course once to get a feel for how a course can be structured and what you can include. After that, feel free to add your own sections, remove sections, and make any changes you like. It's meant to be your playground for editing, tweaking, and learning!</p>
<p>Or if you'd rather experience this course from a <strong>Learner </strong>perspective, just click the blue "View Live Version" button up in the top right corner.</p>
<p><em>Before we get started, we have a quick question for you...</em></p>
