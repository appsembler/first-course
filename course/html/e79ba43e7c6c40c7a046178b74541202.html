<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Welcome to the Appsembler&nbsp;sample course!</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">This course serves&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">Share a bit about Appsembler</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">Demo a finished course built with Tahoe and hosted on Open edX</span></li>
<li><span>Give you something to get started with to avoid the dreaded 'blank page syndrome'</span></li>
<li>Provide tips and insights into how we built this course (#soMeta)</li>
<li>Showcase our hand-on Virtual Labs tool and our premium Tahoe features</li>
</ul>
<p>We suggest going through the course once on your live site (just hit View Live in the top right if you're in Studio!) to get a feel for how a course can be structured and what you can include.&nbsp;Once you're done, you can open the course in Studio<span style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;to add your own sections, remove sections, and make any changes you like. It's meant to be your playground for editing, tweaking, and learning!</span></p>

<p><em>Before we get started, we have a quick question for you...</em></p>
