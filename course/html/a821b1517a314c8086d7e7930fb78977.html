<h3>Studio</h3>
<p>The CMS is where you create learning experiences for your learners, and it's affectionately called Studio (because CMS is a bit boring). In Studio you can use a wide range of tools to create content for your courses and your learners without&nbsp;touching&nbsp;a line of code or downloading anything.</p>

<p>You can see our content on this page is currently a single HTML-based text component. But underneath that in those green boxes there are all sorts of other goodies that can be easily inserted.</p>
<p>All of these can be conveniently put together like building blocks to create a page, whether that's a video, one of many different basic question types like multiple choice, a peer- or staff-graded assessment, an in-content discussion, text... the list goes on.</p>
<p>After you finish this course, we encourage you to&nbsp;explore a bit. You can click&nbsp;the<strong> View in Studio</strong> button on any page to see and edit&nbsp;the course element in Studio!</p>
