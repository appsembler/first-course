<p>Virtual Labs also has another handy feature called&nbsp;<strong>Live Events</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our customers&nbsp;love&nbsp;how easy<strong>&nbsp;Live Events</strong>&nbsp;makes&nbsp;offering hands-on user experience during&nbsp;in-person&nbsp;training and live user conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learners can work with live software on their own computers - all they need is access to a web browser and a link to&nbsp;their very own <strong>Learner Dashboard</strong>.</p>
