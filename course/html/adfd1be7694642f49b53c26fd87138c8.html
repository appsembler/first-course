<p style="text-align: left;">Itential provides powerful network automation software to companies worldwide. They were finding it increasingly difficult to train customers and partners on their proprietary software in an efficient, impactful, and scalable way.</p>
<p>In order to keep pace with growth, Itential partnered with&nbsp;us to bring their entire training program online and into the hands of their learners with immersive, flexible, and scalable lab environments (with Tahoe &amp; Virtual Labs).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The result?&nbsp;Itential saw more than&nbsp;100% growth in training attendance</strong>. Not too shabby! They've also moved from providing expensive, inefficient in-person training that required their trainers to fly back and forth all over the world, to delivering all of their training remotely with Tahoe and Virtual Labs.</p>
<p>Using&nbsp;our Virtual Labs softwware environments, learners can now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run and test Itential&rsquo;s platform with no risk of damaging its infrastructure</li>
<li>Use an HTTP protocol to upgrade, stop, reconfigure and start the Itential platform, as well as access a development environment to learn how to build new applications</li>
<li>Do this from the comfort of their own home or office</li>
</ul>
<p>Itential can also host its course lectures on Tahoe,&nbsp;track learner stats and completion, and provide its customers with dynamic HTML guides to help them troubleshoot problems themselves.</p>
