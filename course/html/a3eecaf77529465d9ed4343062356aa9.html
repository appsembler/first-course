<p>We hope you&nbsp;launched&nbsp;your&nbsp;own Theia&nbsp;container and saw Virtual Labs in action! To add some context,&nbsp;we'll now look at how some of our customers use Virtual Labs in the real world, with actual learners. The main use-cases tend to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software providers give learners hands-on experience with their tools, to drive sales and marketing, allowing users to "try before you buy"</li>
<li>Software companies provide experiential learning to widen industry adoption of their solution</li>
<li><span color="#313131" face="Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #313131; font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Software providers enable tech conference/event attendees to test-drive their tools live on the conference room, using any computer with a web browser (via Virtual Labs Live Events, which we cover later in this unit.)</span></li>
<li>Course authors train learners to complete exercises in open source software to learn their subject (such as data science, machine learning and others)</li>
</ul>
