<p>There's not just tools for learners in the LMS, however! You'll see that you have some buttons down the side of each page - these allow you to <strong>quickly view the page you're on in Studio</strong> (which we'll be talking about soon).</p>

<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p>You'll also see a&nbsp;<strong>Staff Debug Info</strong>&nbsp;button,&nbsp;that enables you to perform&nbsp;advanced troubleshooting on each component that makes up your pages.</p>

<p>At the top of the page you should also have a dropdown to <strong>view the course as a learner</strong>, removing all these additional buttons, or jumping into the shoes of a specific learner enrolled in your course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You also have an additional tab in the top navigation that learners never get to see - the <strong>Instructor Dashboard</strong>.</p>
