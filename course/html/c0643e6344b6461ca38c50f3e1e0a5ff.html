<hr />
<p><strong>To sum it up:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Students ONLY access the LMS.</span></li>
<li><span>You have superpowers in the LMS that only staff members have, while staying in the same environment as your learners.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">Instructors access the LMS for student and course-related functions, but cannot make changes to the&nbsp;<strong>content</strong>&nbsp;of a course here. For that, they must use&nbsp;<strong>Studio</strong>. That's where we're headed next!</span></li>
</ul>
