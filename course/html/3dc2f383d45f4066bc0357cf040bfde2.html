<p>Hands-on training is not a new concept. It's&nbsp;the oldest way of learning! People have been<strong> learning by doing</strong> since before we knew how to write about how to do things. And yet, at some point we&nbsp;thought it was a good idea to start writing books and articles to teach people to use software.</p>
<p>Soon, people&nbsp;realized the futility of this and&nbsp;looked for&nbsp;<strong>hands-on training,</strong> But there&nbsp;are all sorts of technical limitations that&nbsp;get in the way of creating compelling learning experiences. Licensing issues, virtual machine provisioning, having to download the software and install it yourself just to complete an activity... all stuff that isn't relevant to (and gets in the way of) the learning experience.</p>
