<p>You may be familiar with edX.org, one of the largest online learning sites on the web. We&rsquo;ve worked with edX and Open edX for years, but the distinction between the two isn&rsquo;t always clear.&nbsp;First, a bit of broader history. Sorting out <strong>edX</strong> vs. <strong>Open edX</strong> can be confusing.&nbsp;In their own&nbsp;words:</p>
<blockquote class="fancy-blockquote">
<p>"edX is the online learning destination co-founded by Harvard and MIT. Open edX is the learner-centric, massively scalable learning platform behind it. Originally envisioned as a MOOC platform, Open edX has evolved into one of the leading learning platforms catering to Higher Ed, enterprise, and government organizations alike."</p>

<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">Right now, as you go through this course, you are inside</span><strong style="font-size: 1em;"> Open edX!</strong></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">Our team has&nbsp;been involved with <strong>Open edX</strong> since its inception in 2013</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">We've been trusted since 2015 as one of the earliest <strong>Open edX</strong> providers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">Our CEO and Founder, Nate Aune, is one of the foremost <strong>Open edX</strong> authorities in the world.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>From&nbsp;working with companies large and small across multiple industries, we&nbsp;developed a unique understanding of the challenges associated with creating and maintaining an online learning site.&nbsp;Our deep experience in this field is what led us to&nbsp;develop <strong>Tahoe</strong> - the&nbsp;most powerful <strong>Open edX</strong> SaaS offering on the market. (In the next section, we'll explain the ins out outs of&nbsp;Tahoe and how it's different from Open edX.)</p>
<p>But for now just know that&nbsp;in addition to being in&nbsp;<strong>Open edX</strong>, you're also in&nbsp;<strong>Tahoe</strong>. Lucky you!</p>
