<p>The activity below is an example of an Open Response Assessment, affectionately known as ORA, because who doesn't love three letter acronyms (TLAs?). To check it out:</p>
<ol>
<li>Submit an answer</li>
<li>Refresh the page&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hit the "<strong>Grade Available Responses</strong>" button underneath (only visible in the LMS, not Studio!) to give yourself a grade</li>
<li>Refresh again to see your grade once you've given it to yourself</li>
</ol>
<p>This is obviously smoother if you're not the one asking, answering and grading the question! Once you've given yourself a grade, you should see that you also show up in the leaderboard as the top scoring answer! Good job! This is one of many optional features of the ORA component.</p>
