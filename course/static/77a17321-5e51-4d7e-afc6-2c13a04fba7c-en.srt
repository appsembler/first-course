When it comes to teaching and learning new software,

1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,280
nothing compares to real world, hands-on training,

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,000
but it can be frustrating, time consuming and expensive to get

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,970
everyone set up with their own learning environments.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,790
Meet Virtual Labs by Appsembler, the easiest way to deliver hands-on

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,590
software training to anyone, anywhere.

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,590
Skip the IT headaches, save precious training time,

7
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:27,200
and instantly provide your learners with labs that they can complete

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,500
in their web browser, in their own time.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,690
Thousands of different software packages can run in Virtual Labs,

10
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:36,820
and these are just some of the ones that we've worked with in the past.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,220
IDEs, Data analysis software, command lines,

12
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:43,530
databases,even blogging software, but how does it work?

13
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:46,531
Here you can see the Virtual Labs dashboard with a

14
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:49,420
Docker image of our software set up and ready to go.

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,440
The first thing you'll do with your chosen image is to make an admin container.

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,031
This will give your own instance of your software to modify for your learners.

17
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,730
So you'll open up this admin container, which has your software in its default state.

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,011
In this case, the example is a simple development environment, complete with command line and code editor,

19
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:11,920
but this could be almost anything!

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,920
At this point you work with your software to have everything you'll need

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,320
for your learners to take part in whatever activity you're teaching.

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,150
What happens next is entirely dependent on whatever software you're using.

23
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,150
In this example, I'm just adding a simple exercise.

24
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,200
Once you're finished, you head back into Virtual Labs and save

25
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:33,430
it back as a new image. Now that your new image is ready,

26
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,750
you can create a project for your learners to use in Open edX,

27
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,201
Appsembler's LMS.

28
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:46,120
This ID and the project name are actually all you need, so let's head over to Open edX Studio.

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,840
Once you're in Open edX, you'll simply add in the details of your

30
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:52,841
lab into the Container Launcher XBlock Appsembler has built so that your

31
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:55,270
learners can spin it up directly from within the courseware.

32
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,600
Once you're finished with the rest of this page,

33
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,160
you just publish the content for your learners and you're good to go.

34
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,360
Let's go and take a look at it from the learner's perspective.

35
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,500
Here's what they see: after they click the button,

36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,700
the lab is available and learners can start working on their own container from its initial state.

37
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,721
Everyone who clicks the button will get

38
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:23,241
their own individualized lab environment preloaded with the content we prepared

39
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:26,340
for them earlier and ready for them to start learning by doing,

40
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:29,341
and that's all you need to do. With Appsembler's Virtual Labs you can

41
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:33,510
skip the hours of setup and focus on what matters most - your learners.
